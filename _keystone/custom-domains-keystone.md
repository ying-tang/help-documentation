Custom domains (aggregations of projects) are not currently supported within Keystone V3. They may become deprecated or replaced with hierarchical multitenancy at some point in the future.  

For more information, please see [https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/HierarchicalMultitenancy](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/HierarchicalMultitenancy)

If you have a use case for a custom domain, please feel free to bring it up with your dedicated account manager, and we'll work with you to meet your needs.
