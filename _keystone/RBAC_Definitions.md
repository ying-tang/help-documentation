### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and access to OpenStack services

Currently, the only roles that are defined are these:

	•	admin: allows full access across all projects.
	
	•	cloud_admin: allows cloud level access control. This role lets you perform API execution irrespective of the project you belong to.
	•	project_admin: allows project level access control.
	
	•	_member_: allows the user to use the resources (like instances and volumes) that are allocated for the project.

None of these roles provides the level of granularity required to restrict access to a particular OpenStack service.
However, assuming that you are interested in automating updates to Neutron port binding as part of your load balancer failover solution, this may be possible by creating an ID with the **member** role in the desired tenant. Looking at `/etc/neutron/policy.json`, it appears that a port can be updated by any **member** of the tenant (as defined in the "is_owner" rule):

{% highlight bash %}
    "is_owner": "project_id:%(tenant_id)s or project_id:%(project_id)s",
    "admin_or_owner": "rule:cloud_admin_privilege or rule:is_owner or rule:project_admin_privilege",

    "update_port": "rule:admin_or_owner or rule:context_is_advsvc"
{% endhighlight %}

If you would like to see more granular roles in a future release, we can open a feature request to our product team.
