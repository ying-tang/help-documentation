Navigate through the following tabs and provide the values, then click **Launch Instance** on the lower right side of the dialog box.

### Fill in values in the Launch Instance dialog box

#### The Details tab

| **Values**           | **Description** 																																																					 | 
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Instance Name        | Assign a name to your virtual machine. The name that you assign here becomes the initial host name of the server. Server names are not guaranteed to be unique when created, thus you could have two instances with the same host name. |
| Availability Zone    | By default, this value is set to the Availability Zone (AZ) given by the cloud provider, for example, `compute_standard`. 																												 |
| Count	               | To launch multiple instances, enter a value greater than 1. The default is 1.																																																																															  |

Make a selection from the list of networks and click the plus sign (+) to move it to **Allocated**. You can allocate multiple networks to the instance. 

![The Flavor tab]({{site.baseurl}}/img/launch_instance_network.png)

#### The Network Ports tab

If you do not specify any network port, a default one is assigned to the instance when the instance is created and booted.

In rare occasions though, you can create ports beforehand through APIs. After you create a port and associate it with one of the networks that you select in the
 **Networks** tab, you'll be able to view this port in the **Available** table. You can click the plus sign (+) to move it to **Allocated**.     

![The Flavor tab]({{site.baseurl}}/img/launch_instance_port.png)

#### The Security Groups tab

Make a selection from the list of security groups and click the plus sign (+) to move it to **Allocated**.   

![The Security Group tab]({{site.baseurl}}/img/launch_instance_srg.png)        																																																										 |       
 
#### The Key Pair tab

Specify a key pair. You have the following options:

* Select from a list of stored key pairs, and click the plus sign (+) to move it to **Allocated**.   
* Click **Import Key Pair** to import your own key pair. Copy and paste your public key and click **Import Key Pair**.
* Click **Create Key Pair** to create and store a new key pair. Specify the key pair name, and click **Create Key Pair**.  
  
  ![Create a new key pair]({{site.baseurl}}/img/launch_instance_kp.png)

  ![Create a new key pair and save]({{site.baseurl}}/img/launch_instance_kp_new.png)

#### The Configuration tab

Custom scripts are attached to instances to perform specific actions when the instance is launched. You can type your script directly into the **Customization Script** field. 
	
For Linux instances: The default username is `ibmcloud`. To enable password authentication through console and SSH, use the following script data for the Customization Script (with the relevant password in place of `<YOUR_PASSWORD>`):

	#cloud-config password: <YOUR_PASSWORD> chpasswd: { expire: False } ssh_pwauth: True

For Windows instances: To set the initial username and password, use the following script data for the Customization Script (with the relevant username and password in place of `<YOUR_USERNAME>` and `<YOUR_PASSWORD>`).

	rem cmd
	net user <YOUR_USERNAME> <YOUR_PASSWORD> /logonpasswordchg:yes /add /y
	net localgroup administrators <YOUR_USERNAME> /add
	
![Custom script]({{site.baseurl}}/img/launch_instance_script.png)

If your browser supports the HTML5 File API, you may click **Browse** to load your script from a file. The size of your script should not exceed 16 Kb.

In the **Disk Partition** drop-down menu, you can select **Automatic** to resize the disk and set it to a single partition, or select **Manual** to create multiple partitions on the disk.

Select the **Configuration Drive** checkbox if you want to write metadata to a special configuration drive, and specify the metedata in the **Metadata** tab. When the instance boots, it attaches to the configuration drive and accesses the metadata.
	
#### The Metadata tab

A common API is provided by Glance to define key and value pairs to tag metadata for different types of resources (images, artifacts, volumes, flavors, aggregates, and so on). If the image that you select contains pre-defined metadata, you will see them in the **Available metadata** column. 

You can also create additional key and value pairs in the **Custom** field and click the plus sign (+) to move it to the **Existing metadata** list. Example custom metadata is a parameter that you want to pass to the application to be installed with the instance.

![Custom meta]({{site.baseurl}}/img/launch_instance_meta.png)

For more information about Glance metadata, see [Metadata Definition Concepts](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/glance/metadefs-concepts.html) and [Using Glance’s Metadata Definitions Catalog Public APIs](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/glance/glancemetadefcatalogapi.html).

## How to connect to your instance

**Note:** Ensure that proper security group rules are defined for connecting to your instance over `ssh` or `rdp`.

1. Log in to the IBM Blue Box Horizon dashboard.

2. Expand the **Project** panel, then the **Compute** tab in the left navigation area, and click on **Instances**.

3. Locate your instance in the list of running instances and note its IP address, such as `192.168.100.237`.

4. Create a connection to your instance by specifying its IP address.

### Connecting to Linux instances
  
Connect to your instance through SSH or VNC. The default `userid` for the Linux images provided by IBM is **ibmcloud**. Once connected to your Linux instance, you can use the `sudo` command to execute commands that normally require root access. Sudo is configured not to require a password for the default `userid`.

* Use your favorite SSH client and open a connection to the correct IP address of the VM instance, using the private SSH key of the keypair that you specified during provisioning:
	 
	```  
	ssh -i <path_of_Your_SSH_private_key_file> <userid>@<ip_of_instance>
	```
	
* From the IBM Blue Box Horizon dashboard, view the VNC console of the instance by clicking **Console** from the drop-down list in the **Actions** column of the instance. The VNC console connects you with HTTPS.
  
**Note:** To be able to log in via the console to a new Linux instance as `ibmcloud` user, you must have specified a password in the Customization Script during provisioning.
  
### Connecting to Windows instances

Connect to your instance through Remote Desktop or VNC. You'll need to use the `userid` and `password` specified in the Customization Script during VM provisioning. On your first login, a prompt appears, requesting that you change your password. Please do.

* Use your favorite Remote Desktop client to connect.
* From the IBM Blue Box Horizon dashboard, view the VNC console of the instance by clicking **Console** from the drop-down list in the **Actions** column of the instance. The VNC console connects you with HTTPS.
