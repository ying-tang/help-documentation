Q. When configuring a new router with Heat, how do you use a specific IP address from the router's assigned subnet pool?

A.  This procedure is analogous to the way it is used in raw API calls. See https://gist.github.com/ulyssesbbg/0164c4b0141f2c180d5f1e6b226fa3de for an example.

	•	First explicitly specify the subnet and network to be used (using, for example, the `private_net_id` and `private_subnet_id` parameters)
	•	Then specify the IP address for each subnet used.


Q. In Heat, how do you add a route to both the new router and the default-router?

A. Formerly, there were a couple of ways to add a static route in Heat (ExtraRoute and RouterRouter), but those ways are deprecated and no longer supported upstream. You can still use Heat to put static routes in, but you need to put the route in `user_data`. If you prefer, you can also use the script that follows, which has the following syntax:

```
# ./router_route.py test-router2 add 10.0.0.0/24 172.16.0.2
Adding route to 10.0.0.0/24 via 172.16.0.2

# ./router_route.py test-router2 delete 10.0.0.0/24 172.16.0.2
Deleting route to 10.0.0.0/24 via 172.16.0.2

#!/usr/bin/python

from keystoneauth1 import identity
from keystoneauth1 import session
from neutronclient.v2_0 import client
import os
import sys

if ( len( sys.argv ) < 5 ):
  print "Usage: " + sys.argv[0] + " <router_name_or_id> <[add|delete]> <destination> <nexthop>"
  exit( 254 )

router_id = sys.argv[1]
verb = sys.argv[2]
destination = sys.argv[3]
nexthop = sys.argv[4]

auth = identity.Password( auth_url = os.environ["OS_AUTH_URL"],
                          username = os.environ["OS_USERNAME"],
                          password = os.environ["OS_PASSWORD"],
                          project_name = os.environ["OS_PROJECT_NAME"],
                          project_domain_id = os.environ["OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME"],
                          user_domain_id = os.environ["OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME"] )

sess = session.Session( auth = auth )
neutron = client.Client( session = sess )

for router in neutron.list_routers()["routers"]:
  if ( router["name"] == router_id or router["id"] == router_id ):

    if ( verb == "add" ):
      print "Adding route to " + destination + " via " + nexthop
      router["routes"].append( { "destination": destination, "nexthop": nexthop } )

    elif ( verb == "delete" ):
      index = 0

      for route in router["routes"]:
        if ( route["destination"] == destination and route["nexthop"] == nexthop ):
          print "Deleting route to " + destination + " via " + nexthop
          router["routes"].pop( index )

        index += 1

    neutron.update_router( router["id"], { "router": { "routes": router["routes"] } } )

```
