#### IBM Blue Box Cloud Building Blocks

Every IBM Blue Box Cloud 2.1.0 starts with a hyper-converged cluster of Controller and Compute nodes, along with:

	•	For a Standard Capacity cloud, Dedicated Gateway Firewalls are included by default
	•	Enterprise Capacity includes double the resources and 10 Gbps of network connectivity 
	•	Dedicated controller nodes 
	•	Compute nodes: Standard or Enterprise

#### Optional Expansion Compute Nodes Now Available

Optionally, you can select from the following compute and storage node extensions to add to your standard or enterprise cloud:

	•	You can select specialized expansion compute nodes: IO, or HIGH STORAGE (New in this release)
	•	You can select additional standard or enterprise compute nodes: STANDARD COMPUTE, or ENTERPRISE COMPUTE

Expansion compute nodes address your requirements for faster IO ephemeral, more RAM, and an order of magnitude larger ephemeral storage.  Both types of expansion nodes—IO optimized and high storage capacity—allow better coverage of instance types and workloads. With this 2.1.0 release, compute types are grouped into Availability Zones for easy targeting of workloads to the appropriate compute type.

#### Optional Hybrid Block Storage Nodes Now Available

Hybrid Block Storage nodes provide lower cost and higher density Block Storage.  

	•	You can select Block Storage: SSD or HYBRID
	•	You can select Object Storage 

#### Direct Link now Available in SoftLayer Data Centers

For Dedicated Cloud, you have the additional network option of selecting **Direct Link** connectivity:

	•	You can select an access method  (Public, VPN, or Direct Link)

Direct Link is available in SoftLayer Data centers. It lets you connect to the SoftLayer private network backbone or network, bypassing the public Internet to connect to your Dedicated cloud(s). It is available in 1Gbps and 10Gbps increments.

Available:

	•	IBM Blue Box Dedicated Direct Link Cloud Exchange 1 Gbps
	•	IBM Blue Box Dedicated Direct Link Cloud Exchange 10 Gbps
	•	IBM Blue Box Dedicated Direct Link Colocation 1 Gbps
	•	IBM Blue Box Dedicated Direct Link Colocation 10 Gbps
	•	IBM Blue Box Dedicated Direct Link Network Service Provider (NSP) 1 Gbps
	•	IBM Blue Box Dedicated Direct Link Network Service Provider (NSP) 10 Gbps

**NOTE:** Direct Link can be utilized to create a hybrid cloud, if you want to link your Local cloud to a Dedicated cloud that is running in a SoftLayer data center.

#### SoftLayer Private Network Access

SoftLayer Private Network access lets you set up connectivity between two IBM Blue Box Dedicated private clouds, using the SoftLayer private network capability, when both of the IBM Blue Box clouds that will be connected are deployed under the same SoftLayer account.

For more information, please refer to [the main document on this topic.](https://github.com/IBM-Blue-Box-Help/help-documentation/blob/gh-pages/_gettingstarted/Connecting_Clouds_with_SoftLayer.md)

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Several roles are created by default that give you specific access capabilities within your cloud. This version of IBM Blue Box Cloud introduces the concept of **groups**. For more information about users, roles, and groups, please refer to this document:

https://github.com/IBM-Blue-Box-Help/help-documentation/blob/gh-pages/_keystone/Managing_Users_and_Projects.md

#### Additional Cloud Images Available

IBM Blue Box Cloud 2.1.0 comes pre-populated with Cirros 0.3.3 x86_64 images. Additional cloud images are available, provided as a customer courtesy by IBM Blue Box. These include:

	•	CentOS 6.7 x86_64
	•	CentOS 7.2 x86_64
	•	Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS x86_64
	•	Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS x86_64
	•	Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 Datacenter
	•	Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 Enterprise
	•	Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 Standard
	•	Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter
	•	Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard

To use any of these images, additional information is provided in this document:

#### HIPAA and IBM Blue Box Dedicated Cloud

	•	You can select HIPAA Enablement for your IBM Blue Box Dedicated Cloud

A HIPAA-enabled cloud has the same configuration and expansion options as any other IBM Blue Box Cloud offering. It must be noted that a HIPAA-enabled cloud must be HIPAA-enabled from its inception. Also, you cannot downgrade from an IBM Blue Box Dedicated HIPAA cloud.  The existing HIPAA cloud must be wiped—per HIPAA protocol—and you must order a new Dedicated cloud with non-HIPAA controllers.

An IBM Blue Box Dedicated HIPAA cloud is like any other Dedicated cloud with three exceptions:

	1.	Every IBM Blue Box Dedicated HIPAA cloud must have IBM Blue Box Dedicated Controllers.
	2.	Additional HIPAA monthly recurring charges accrue per cluster and per asset under management.
	3.	Additional (50+) controls are enabled, and responsibility for those controls is shared between you and IBM Blue Box.

IBM Blue Box Dedicated HIPAA clouds can be deployed in any SoftLayer data center that is IBM Blue Box Dedicated ready.

**Pre-requisite:** A BAA must be signed before a of IBM Blue Box Dedicated HIPAA cloud order can be initiated. You must initiate your cloud order using the minimum configuration for HIPAA customers. No HIPAA enablement can be done after service initiation.

#### Summary of New Features from Previous Releases that will affect Customer Use of this Release

This section briefly lists features from previous IBM Blue Box Cloud releases, primarily the 2.0.1 release, that will have an effect on your experience when using this 2.1.0 release, especially if you are upgrading from a 1.x release. For more information about these features, please contact your IBM Blue Box support team.


#### _Features that will affect Users, Groups, and Roles in this release:_

**Hide Host Aggregates panel from `cloud_admin`**

* This Horizon panel has been removed from visibility from `cloud_admin` users. We no longer allow `cloud_admin` to manipulate Host Aggregates, so it was improper to display this panel in Horizon.

**Expose more `admin` panels to `cloud_admin`**

* We've enabled more admin panels for the `cloud_admin` users in Horizon. These include "Overview," "Hypervisors," "Instances," "Volumes," "Flavors," "Images," and "Defaults."

**Fix user management by name on the command line**

* We've fixed a defect that prevented the management of users by name from the command line. Previously, many attempts to reference a user by name would result in an error.

**Restrict password requirements just to `admin` user**

* Strict password requirements for OpenStack users have been eliminated for all but the "admin" user (which Blue Box retains).

**Allow `cloud_admin` to make Glance images public**

* The `cloud_admin` role now has the privileges to make Glance images public.

**Disallow `cloud_admin` from managing Host Aggregates**

* Covered above in discussion of the Host Aggregates panel for Horizon


#### _Features that will affect Horizon, Glance, Nova, and Heat in this release:_

**Refresh Horizon code base to fix bugs with volume backups**

* A defect in Horizon that prevented creation of Cinder volume backups has been resolved.

**Refresh Horizon code base to allow image upload from Swift URL (curated IBM Blue Box image delivery)**

* A defect in Glance preventing uploading images via a URL has been resolved, allowing URLs from Box Panel to be used to upload images into Glance.

**Update Horizon logos for IBM branding**

* The Horizon logo has been updated to reflect the Blue Box and IBM relationship.

**Add DiskFilter for Nova scheduling**

* We've resolved a defect that would lead to Nova scheduling builds on Hypervisors that did not have enough free disk space to satisfy the build.

**Tune Heat for large template support:** `bugs.launchpad.net/heat/+bug/1491185`

* We've resolved a defect that would hinder Heat stack deployments with large templates.

**Future Release Notes**

Release Notes will be published periodically that give details about what has changed and how it could influence your experience with your IBM Blue Box Cloud offering. For instance, when a new version of OpenStack is installed that might enable new features, you’ll receive Release Notes containing the details.
