## Welcome to the IBM Bluemix Private Cloud (formerly Blue Box) Managed Hosting User Guide


This document offers a way for our Bluemix Private Cloud (formerly Blue Box) Managed Hosting customers to find information they need as they are migrating to other cloud service providers.

To learn how to get the latest status updates, including information about maintenance windows, visit the [Bluemix Private Cloud Status Pages](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/gettingstarted/commonadmin/status-pages/).

To learn how to transfer your domain name to your new cloud service provider, please visit our [article on that topic](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/gettingstarted/commonadmin/Transferring_A_Domain_From_Blue_Box/).

Best wishes to you from the IBM Bluemix Private Cloud Support Team.
