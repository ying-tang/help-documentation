## Getting Started with Box Panel

The Box Panel interface gives you a single, consolidated view of assets deployed in your **IBM Bluemix Private Cloud** and **IBM Bluemix Private Cloud Local** environments. Its self-service access lets you create support tickets, leverage central authentication for logins and user permissions, monitor various functions, and view your invoices, easily. 

This user guide gives you an end-to-end overview, so you can get started using Box Panel to monitor and control your IBM Bluemix Cloud environment. This document applies to Box Panel Version 3.8.3 and later.

To view and update your customer contact information in Box Panel, do the following steps:

* Log into Box Panel.
* From the **Account** menu, choose **Account Contacts** to open the Account Contacts page.
* All contacts authorized to access your account are listed under the Authorized Contacts section. Each person’s name and e-mail address are listed, along with three contact roles (note that a contact can have one or more of these contact roles):

  * **Admin (A)** contacts can order or remove services, and also manage other contacts
  * **Billing (B)** contacts can view and pay invoices
  * **Technical (T)** contacts can open tickets and contact the Bluemix Private Cloud Support team for assistance
  * **Primary (P)** contact. This one person (only one) retains administrative control over the account.  The Primary Contact may only be changed by IBM Bluemix Private Cloud support staff.
 
To add a new contact, click the **Add Contact** button. The **Add a Contact** form will display, allowing you to enter the contact’s name, email address, telephone number and which role(s) the contact should belong to.  When done, click the Save Details button to add the contact.

To remove an existing contact, click the X on the row with their name in the Authorized Contacts list.

Notice that the Primary Contact cannot be removed. Please contact IBM Bluemix Private Cloud support for assistance in modifying the Primary Contact.
    
### Working with Cloud Images 

The **Cloud Images** page in Box Panel is available to customers who have at least one cloud, and who are either a **Primary** or a **Technical** customer contact. If you qualify as a user, the **Services** navigation will include a **Cloud Images** link with access to the page.

To view the Customer Help documentation for IBM Bluemix Private Cloud, select **OpenStack**. The Help page will appear. You can browse the documentation by category, or you can search, using the search bar. By hovering over one of the icons, you can see a list of articles within that topic area.

### Getting Support 

**Note: For immediate support, you can call Bluemix Private Cloud Support at 1-800-613-4305 or email us at support@bluebox.net.**

In most cases, you'll want to open a support ticket to get support. By using a ticket, you'll have a record of the issue and the solutions taken to address your issue, complete with logs of your chat sessions with the customer support team.

**To create a ticket:**

Step 1. Click **New Ticket** from the **Support** page.

Step 3. Select a category (**Support** or **Billing**). Verify the user list that should have access to your ticket.

Step 4. Copy additional users in the **CC additional users** field to make them aware of the ticket and track its status.

Step 5. Add a descriptive subject to the ticket.

Step 6. Collect and add all useful information to the **Description** section, such as:

 * Date and time the issue began

 * Affected server name(s) 
 * Affected data center(s)

**Note: Steps 9 and 10 can be skipped for non-urgent concerns.**

 Step 9. If the issue is urgent, you can check the **Open this Ticket as Urgent** box to escalate the ticket. This click will prompt an acknowledgement that you consent to pay consulting charges if the issue is non-critical (critical items would include situations in which there are outages).
 
 Step 10. If you wish to open your ticket as **Urgent** and consent to pay the consulting charges for non-critical items, check the **I Agree** box.
 
 Step 11. Finally, click the **Create Ticket** box. 

**Using Your Support Ticket**

Anytime after a ticket is created, you can see the text associated with that ticket, by clicking on that support ticket from your Dashboard. The ticket's text may include references to other tickets, as well as chat history and any correspondence related to your selected ticket. The status of your support ticket is highlighted in the top right corner. Status indicators include OPEN, PENDING COMPLETION, PARKED, and so forth.

![ ](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/img/ticket_status.jpg)

From the panel on the left-hand side of the screen, you can select options to create another new support ticket, subscribe to the ticket you have selected (if you want to follow its status), view your tickets, and view all tickets submitted by shared users on your account. 

To view a list of Subscribers for a selected ticket, click on the **Subscribers** link. 

To have a written conversation with one of our Bluemix Private Cloud support team experts about the topic of this ticket, you can click the green **Post Reply** button, or you can use the live **Chat** feature by clicking on **Chat**. All live chat sessions are recorded and added to the ticket as a transcript.

**Using the Chat Feature to chat with Bluemix Private Cloud Support**

1. Click the **Chat** tab from your Dashboard. This action automatically directs you to a chat room with support staff. 
2. From here, you are able to view the support staff members join your conversation on the left-hand side of the chat room.
3. Once a support member joins, you can compose and send messages from the chat bar. If you need to enter a new line during your chat, press **Control/Command + Enter**.
4. If you need to escalate your support issue, please call 1-800-613-4305 ext 1.

**Note:** Each customer chat room is private. This means that only the contacts within your customer account and the Bluemix Private Cloud support staff have access to your transcript. No sensitive data (such as credit card numbers, or private keys) persists.
