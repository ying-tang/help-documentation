### **Tips:**

To check for more details about a Windows system update, please access the URL for a specific update as follows:

```
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/<update_number>
```

Please replace the `<update_number>` in above URL with the **digits** of the actual system update number.

For example, if the system update number is **KB3118401**, it would link to the following URL:

```
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3118401
```

### **Known limitation of Windows images:**

The maximum RAM size to provision Windows VM instances is **64GB**. Windows VM instances provisioned with RAM size larger than 64GB may fail to boot up. This failure is caused by the limited free disk space in the image to provision large `pagefile.sys` file for virtual memory used by the Windows system. While there is a workaround solution available, to get a Windows VM instance with more than 64GB RAM, please provision it initially with 64GB RAM or less, and then do a **resize** for that VM instance with another flavor which has a RAM size larger than 64GB.
